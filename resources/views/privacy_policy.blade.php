 <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
 <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
 <ul type="disc">
     <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed,
         further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
     </li>
     <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
     <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
         processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
     </li>
     <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other
         providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
     <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed

 </ul>
 <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections,
     deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation
     does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a
     right to information about these recipients.</p>
 <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's future
         processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
         processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
 <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
 <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases
     to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless
     otherwise stipulated below.</p>
 <h4>Server data</h4>
 <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will be
     collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and version of
     your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited,
     the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.</p>
 <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
 <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
     stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>
 <p>The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary
     purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the investigation of the
     relevant incident is finally resolved.</p>
 <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
 <p>We use Google Analytics on our website. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon
     House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>
 <p>The Google Analytics service is used to analyze how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f)
     GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our site.</p>
 <p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our website will
     be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the
     so-called anonymization function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the EEA before it is
     transmitted to the US.</p>
 <p>The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our website
     and what visitors do once there. This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our
     website and of the internet in general.</p>
 <p>Google states that it will not connect your IP address to other data. In addition, Google provides further
     information with regard to its data protection practices at</p>
 <p><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank"
         rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners,</a></p>
 <p>including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.</p>
 <p>In addition, Google offers an opt-out add-on at</p>
 <p><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank"
         rel="noopener">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>
 <p>in addition with further information. This add-on can be installed on the most popular browsers and offers you
     further control over the data that Google collects when you visit our website. The add-on informs Google Analytics'
     JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However,
     this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services we may use as
     detailed herein.</p>
